# payment_method

`payment_method` is **required**. Each _WooCommerce Payment Gateway_ has a unique `ID`. You can find the corresponding `payment_method` in the detail guide in the end.

For _Direct Bank Transfer_, We use `bacs` as `payment_method` as our choice of Payment Method.

For more on different Gateways and their `payment_method`, please visit the detail guide.
